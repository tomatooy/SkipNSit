#Inspiration
Traditionally, concerts and national sports events are crowded while entering, resorting to long wait times. We want to make this process easy and convenient.

#What it does
Skip’N Sit is an application that is provided for users that are attending concerts or other national sports events. Skip’N Sit will eliminate all waiting lines and will provide directions on how to get to their designated seat depending on the ticket number. In other words, attendees can walk straight into the arena and do not need to worry about their seat being taken because the seat is only accessible by the user. Meaning that the ticket number that the user entered will be linked with a QR code on the chair when they purchase the ticket. Additionally, the users can purchase food that is on the app without leaving their seats, and it will be delivered by staff members after checkout. Hence, the user is required to enter their ticket number as a login credential.
